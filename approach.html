            <div class="text-block-131">When it comes to leadership and collaboration, I value straightforward communication and clearly defined initiatives. By simplifying complex ideas and breaking them down into manageable steps, I can help ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.<br><br>Another important aspect of my approach is trust. As a leader, I believe in trusting my team and empowering them to do their best work. I never micromanage, but instead provide guidance and support when needed. By fostering a culture of trust and respect, I&#x27;ve seen firsthand how it can lead to increased creativity, productivity, and overall job satisfaction.<br><br>I also believe in the importance of failure. Rather than being discouraged by setbacks, I view them as opportunities to learn, grow, and ask better questions. By approaching challenges with a growth mindset, I&#x27;m able to pivot quickly and adapt to changing circumstances. This approach has allowed me to not only overcome obstacles, but also to uncover new opportunities for innovation and improvement.<br><br>Keeping meetings lean is another important part of my approach. I understand that everyone&#x27;s time is valuable, and that long, drawn-out meetings can be counterproductive. Instead, I strive to keep meetings focused and efficient, with clear agendas and actionable takeaways. By respecting everyone&#x27;s time, we can all stay focused on what matters most - delivering high-quality work that meets our goals and exceeds expectations.<br><br>Finally, I believe in being humble and open-minded. I&#x27;ll be the first to admit when I don&#x27;t know something, and I&#x27;m always eager to learn from others. By approaching each new challenge with a beginner&#x27;s mindset, I can stay curious and open to new ideas and perspectives. This approach has allowed me to build strong relationships with colleagues and collaborators, and to create truly innovative work that pushes boundaries and exceeds expectations.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my approach to work, leadership, and collaboration. If you&#x27;re interested in learning more or have any questions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!</div>

              <div class="text-block-132">TL;DR</div>
              <div class="text-block-133"><strong>time </strong>my time, your time, the team’s time, the customer’s time - pretty much all the times! valuing time so highly means listening intently without distraction, only holding meetings that couldn’t be an email, and considering what’s most important in every moment. <br>‍<br><strong>creativity </strong>creativity isn’t just making things, it’s also not making things. it’s an environment where we can flourish, playing the angles, not judging yourself or others, <br><strong><br>transparency </strong>be honest about who you are, what you can handle and what you can’t. there’s no shame in having emotions, sharing them in a healthy way is transparency. it makes us work better together, build tighter cultures, not waste time, etc.<br>‍<br><strong>diversity </strong>perspective is the fabric of reality, and the more perspectives we have properly represented in our society the more beautiful and fulfilling reality can be. <br><strong><br>simplicity </strong>progress only happens when the stuff we do and think becomes easier. simplicity allows us to remove distractions, trim the fluff and drive customer understanding. progress is when complexity becomes simple. </div>
